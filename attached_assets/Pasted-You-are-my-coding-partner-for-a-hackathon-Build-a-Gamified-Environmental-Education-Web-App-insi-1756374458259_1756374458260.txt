You are my coding partner for a hackathon. Build a **Gamified Environmental Education Web App** inside this Repl using **React (Vite) + Tailwind CSS + Firebase + Phaser.js + Recharts + Framer Motion**.  

🎯 Project Goal:
- Teach school students about sustainability through fun mini-games.
- Reward them with eco-facts, badges, and points.
- Show leaderboards and analytics for teachers.
- Deployable in Replit with Firebase backend.

---

## 1. App Structure
- React with Vite setup
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- Firebase SDK for auth, Firestore DB
- Phaser.js for games
- Recharts.js for teacher analytics

📂 Folder structure:
/src
/components
/games
WasteSorting.jsx
WaterSaver.jsx
PlantTree.jsx
/dashboard
TeacherDashboard.jsx
Leaderboard.jsx
/auth
Login.jsx
Signup.jsx
firebaseConfig.js
App.jsx
index.css

yaml
Copy code

---

## 2. Firebase Integration
- Use Firebase Auth (email + Google login)
- Firestore DB collections:
  - `users` → { name, role: "student"/"teacher", score, badges }
  - `leaderboard` → { userId, score }
  - `ecoFacts` → list of sustainability facts
- Firebase config stored in `firebaseConfig.js` with placeholders for API keys (use Replit Secrets Manager).

---

## 3. Authentication
- `/auth/Login.jsx`: Email + Google login
- `/auth/Signup.jsx`: Simple signup
- After login:
  - If role = "student" → redirect to `/games`
  - If role = "teacher" → redirect to `/dashboard`

---

## 4. Homepage
- A landing page with 2 buttons:
  - 🎮 “Play as Student” → login/signup as student
  - 📊 “Teacher Dashboard” → login/signup as teacher
- Animated title with Framer Motion

---

## 5. Student Side (Mini-Games)
### Game 1: Waste Sorting
- Drag-and-drop trash items (plastic, paper, organic) into correct bins
- Phaser.js canvas
- Score points for correct drops
- Show “Eco Fact” popup at the end

### Game 2: Water Saver Clicker
- Timer-based game (10 seconds)
- Click to stop dripping taps before water fills bucket
- Each saved tap = +5 points
- Badge: “Water Saver” if score > 50

### Game 3: Plant a Tree
- Interactive growth simulation
- User clicks to “water” the tree → grows in 3 stages
- Reward: “Green Thumb” badge when fully grown

After each game:
- Save score + badge in Firestore
- Show random eco fact with animation

---

## 6. Student Dashboard
- Show earned badges (icons)
- Show total points
- Button to play again

---

## 7. Teacher Dashboard
- `/dashboard/TeacherDashboard.jsx`
- Show **Leaderboard** (top 10 students by score)
- Show **Class Analytics**:
  - Average score
  - Total badges earned
- Charts using **Recharts.js**
- Export button → download CSV of student scores

---

## 8. Leaderboard
- Real-time leaderboard with Firestore snapshot listener
- Animated score updates with Framer Motion

---

## 9. Styling & UI
- Use Tailwind for modern clean design
- Buttons → big, rounded, gradient
- Background → eco theme (greens, blues)
- Game canvas embedded in React component with responsive size

---

## 10. Deployment
- Runs fully on Replit
- Uses Firebase Auth + Firestore
- Public preview link works for judges

---

⚡ Deliverables:
1. Fully working React app with 3 games.
2. Student flow: Login → Play → Badges → Leaderboard.
3. Teacher flow: Login → Dashboard → Charts → Export CSV.
4. Deployed live link.

Now start coding step by step, generate files as per structure, and ensure everything is runnable in Replit.
✅ This is super detailed — when pasted into Replit Agent, it will scaffold everything: UI, Firebase, games, dashboards, and flows.

Do you want me to also make a step-by-step judge demo script (what you should show during hackathon presentation → like play a game, show leaderboard update, switch to teacher view)?

Here are some 🔥 name ideas for your gamified environmental hackathon app (short, catchy, and eco-themed):

EcoQuest 🌍🎮 – fun + mission-like

GreenPlay 🌱 – simple, student-friendly

Sustainify ♻️ – modern, tech vibe

EcoSpark ⚡ – sparks awareness

Planet Heroes 🌍🦸 – makes kids feel like heroes

EcoFun 🌿 – short, playful

EarthUp 🌎⬆️ – level up the planet

EnviroQuest 🌍 – adventurous tone

Green Champs 🏆🌱 – leaderboard vibe

EcoRise 🌱🚀 – progress + positive

👉 Since hackathon judges like short, catchy names with a strong theme, my top pick for you would be:
EcoQuest 🌍🎮 (mission + fun + easy to brand)

Would you like me to also design a logo prompt for your app name (so you can generate a logo fast during hackathon)?

Got it 👍 Since you’re building a Replit project for the hackathon, I’ll give you a clean file management structure for your gamified environmental education app (EcoQuest 🌍🎮).

Here’s a suggested file structure:

bash
Copy code
ecoquest/
│── main.py                     # Entry point (FastAPI backend + WebSocket for real-time)
│── requirements.txt             # Dependencies (FastAPI, Socket.IO, SQLAlchemy, etc.)
│── README.md                    # Project documentation
│
├── backend/
│   │── __init__.py
│   │── database.py              # Database connection (SQLite/Postgres)
│   │── models.py                # DB models (Users, Scores, Quizzes, Progress)
│   │── routes.py                # API routes (login, quizzes, leaderboard, etc.)
│   │── game_logic.py            # Handles minigame scoring & rules
│   │── ai_recommendations.py    # AI engine for tips & awareness
│
├── frontend/

│   │── script.js                # Client-side logic (fetch API, real-time, minigames)
│   │── assets/                  # Images, icons, sounds
│       │── logo.png
│       │── eco_icons/
│       │── sounds/
│
├── minigames/                   # Each minigame is modular
│   │── __init__.py
│   │── recycle_sort.py          # Drag & drop waste segregation
│   │── water_saver.py           # Tap timing game
│   │── carbon_quiz.py           # Multiple choice carbon footprint quiz
│   │── tree_plant.py            # Click-to-grow tree game
│
├── ai_models/                   # Optional (for extra points!)
│   │── eco_chatbot.py           # Simple AI-powered Q&A chatbot
│   │── nlp_model.pkl            # Pre-trained model (if needed)
│
└── utils/
    │── helpers.py               # Utility functions
    │── constants.py             # Configs & constants (points, thresholds, etc.)
⚡ How Each Part Works:
main.py → Runs the backend server. Serves frontend, handles API requests, connects minigames with database.

backend/ → Manages users, scores, and AI tips.

frontend/ → Your UI/UX layer (HTML + CSS + JS for animations, leaderboards, quizzes).

minigames/ → Each minigame is plug & play. Judges will love that you can “expand later.”

ai_models/ → Bonus! A mini chatbot giving eco-tips (AI edge).

utils/ → Reusable constants & helpers.
