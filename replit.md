# Overview

Planet Heroes is a fully functional gamified environmental education web application designed to teach school students about sustainability through interactive mini-games. The platform features role-based access for students and teachers, with students earning points and badges through gameplay while teachers can monitor progress through analytics dashboards. The application uses a modern React-based frontend with Firebase for authentication and data persistence, creating an engaging educational experience that promotes environmental awareness.

## Current Status: COMPLETED âœ…
- All three mini-games fully implemented (Waste Sorting, Water Saver, Plant Tree)

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The application uses a modern React-based frontend built with Vite for fast development and optimized builds. The UI is constructed using shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS for styling, providing a consistent and responsive design system. Framer Motion is integrated for smooth animations and transitions throughout the user experience.

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Component-based architecture**: Modular React components for reusability and maintainability
- **Route-based navigation**: Using Wouter for client-side routing with separate portals for students and teachers
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS breakpoints
- **Animation system**: Framer Motion for engaging user interactions and game feedback

## Authentication & Authorization
Firebase Authentication provides secure user management with Google OAuth integration. The system implements role-based access control distinguishing between students and teachers, with different interfaces and permissions for each role.

**Authentication Flow:**
- Google OAuth for simplified sign-in process
- Automatic user profile creation in Firestore
- Role-based routing and component rendering
- Session persistence across browser refreshes

## Data Layer
Firestore serves as the primary database for user profiles, game scores, and educational content. The data model supports real-time updates for leaderboards and progress tracking.

**Database Collections:**
- `users`: Student and teacher profiles with points, badges, and metadata
- Game scores and progress tracking
- Real-time leaderboard data synchronization

## Game Engine
Custom HTML5 Canvas-based mini-games focus on environmental education themes including waste sorting, water conservation, and tree planting. Each game provides immediate feedback and educational content through eco-facts.

**Game Architecture:**
- Canvas-based rendering for interactive gameplay
- Modular game components for different environmental themes
- Score calculation and badge awarding system
- Educational content integration through modal overlays

## Backend Services
The application uses a hybrid architecture with a Node.js/Express server for potential API endpoints and static file serving, while leveraging Firebase for real-time data operations and authentication.

**Server Configuration:**
- Express.js server with Vite integration for development
- Static file serving for production builds
- API route structure for potential future backend operations
- Development-optimized hot reloading
